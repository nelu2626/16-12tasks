        <h2> Wildlife Conservation Projects</h2>
        <p> Conservation is not specifically defined in Indian statutes, although it generally refers to the â€˜maintenance, protection, or restoration of the natural environment and animals.
            Wildlife Conservation projects aim to preserve and use natural resources in a sustainable manner. This is done to ensure that future generations can benefit from these resources. Wildlife is an essential element of nature, so it must be protected.
            Conservation programs are designed to bridge the gap between evolutionary theory and environmental realities. This assists in forecasting how wildlife will respond to current and future environmental changes. It was designed to ensure their survival because global warming, farming, population increase, pollution, and hunting pose significant threats to them.
